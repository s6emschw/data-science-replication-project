# Project for the course in OSE Data Science | Summer 2021, M.Sc. Economics, Bonn University | Emily Schwab

My final project for the OSE Data Science course replicates the results published in the following journal article:

* **Kazianga, H., Levy, D., Linden, L. L., & Sloan, M. (2013)**. The Effects of “Girl-Friendly” Schools: Evidence from the BRIGHT School Construction Program in Burkina Faso. *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 5(3), 41-62.

The published article as well as the project's data set and corresponding code can be accessed [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.5.3.41).

## How to view this notebook:

* To view this notebook, please download the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-data-science-course-projeect-s6emschw). Alternatively, it is possible to use _MyBinder_ or _NBViewer_. In the case that the causal graph images located in section 4 of the notebook do not appear while using these alternative viewing options, they are also available in the repository's [files](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-data-science-course-projeect-s6emschw/tree/master/files) folder. 

* **Note:** Since I last tried rendering my notebook using the alternative viewing options, _NBViewer_ continues to show an old version of my notebook. To see the final version, I recommend viewing the project notebook locally or with _MyBinder_. 

## Final Project Summary

In Kazianga et al. (2013), the authors use a regression discontinuity design (RD design) to examine the effects of a "girl-friendly" primary school program implemented by the Ministry of Education in Burkina Faso. Despite an increase in primary school enrollment throughout the world, many regions including sub-Saharan Africa are struggling to catch up. As late as 2010, the net primary school enrollment rate in sub-Saharan Africa was 76 percent, approximately 14 percentage points below the average for emerging countries.

To improve academic outcomes in rural regions of Burkina Faso, the Burkinabé Response to Improve Girls’ Chances to Succeed (BRIGHT) program selected 132 villages to participate in an education policy package that 1) increased access to schools and 2) offered unique amenities to encourage school enrollment among girls of primary-school age. The program provided each village with a three-classroom school, housing for three teachers, gender-segregated bathroom facilities, and a source of clean water. The schools were also equipped with student and teacher desks, chairs, metal bookshelves, two multipurpose halls, and a playground. Additionally, the BRIGHT program implemented a series of interventions to incentivize children, parents, and teachers.

For my final project, I introduce the basic properties of the RD design and its strengths as an identification strategy. I also replicate the main findings reported in Kazianga et al. (2013) and provide further insights through a number of project extensions described in section 6 of my project notebook. My replication results and robustness extensions corroborate the results published by the authors in the original journal article.
